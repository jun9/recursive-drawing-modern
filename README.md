# Recursive Drawing Modern

## Overview
This repository focuses on modern recursive drawing techniques. The goal is to explore and implement various algorithms that utilize recursion for generating complex and beautiful visual patterns.

## Features
- Recursive algorithms for drawing various shapes and patterns.
- Highly customizable parameters to alter drawing behavior.
- Easy integration with common drawing libraries.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jun9/recursive-drawing-modern.git
cd recursive-drawing-modern
```

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (refer to requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the main drawing script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
After running the script, you can customize the parameters in the code to experiment with different recursive patterns. Details on how to modify parameters will be included in the documentation.

## Example
Below is an example of a simple recursive pattern generated using the algorithms in this repository:
